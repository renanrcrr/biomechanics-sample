# Code that simulates a basic biomechanics problem involving projectile motion

In this sample of code, I calculate the trajectory of a projectile launched at a certain angle and initial velocity, taking into account the effects of gravity.

I simulates the trajectory of a projectile using kinematic equations and considers the effects of gravity. 

It calculates the time of flight, horizontal range, and maximum height of the projectile. 

Keep in mind that this is a simplified sample.
