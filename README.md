# Code that simulates a basic biomechanics problem involving projectile motion

This code sample shows the code implementation, make sure you have the XChart library installed. It's necessary add project's dependencies in your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle).

I've added calculations for air resistance to the projectile motion simulation. The code now calculates the drag force, acceleration, and updated velocity components considering air resistance. 

The chart displays the trajectory of the projectile, including the effect of air resistance. .

PS: To works like a charm you need the XChart library installed and configured to run this code.
